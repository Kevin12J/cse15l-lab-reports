## Reflection
Something really helpful that I learned was about was using git in order to effectively colaborate with others on projects. I did use git prior to taking 15L, but I used it to simply backup my code. The lab experiences have taught me how to take advantage of the many other functionalities in git. For example, I learned about using branches in git which will be helpful for when I want to work on a seperate part of a project without impacting the main branch. Another useful tool that I learned in lab was the use of pull requests. Pull requests will be helpful for when I want to report bugs and offer potential fixes especially on open source projects. Learning git through lab has been very helpful, and I am excited to use it more in the future.
